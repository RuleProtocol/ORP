# RP

RP(Rule Protocol) ：It aims to provide a unified multi-paradigm rule protocol for the web3 ecosystem to handle different business scenario requirements and enable the web3 world to run logically and systematically.



### ID

User identity is used to indicate the user’s identity on the chain.



### Token

Fungible token serve as distribution indicators for quantitative contributions within the RP system.



### NFT

Non-fungible tokens are used to identify ID’s functions and past contributions within the RP system.



### Rule

Rules are the link between all relationships within the RP system.

The rule is the circulation channel of Token and NFT between IDs.

ID only needs to choose to call different rules according to its own needs to achieve the acquisition and transfer of Token and NFT.



### RP

RP is an on-chain ID, Token, and NFT. Through agreed rules, it achieves a rule agreement for asset circulation and empowering off-chain value.

RP is a rule agreement that creates an efficient collaborative relationship between IDs through a regularized asset transfer method.



### Derivation

Based on the RP protocol, a variety of rule protocols are built to solve Web3 business problems.



#### ORP (Orginazation Rule Protocol)

It is a rule and agreement standard for dealing with human production relations and distribution according to work.



#### GRP(Game Rule Protocol) 

It is a protocol standard for handling NFT characters, NFT items, NFT attributes, and NFT relationships within the game system.



#### FRP(Finance Rule Protocol) 

It is a standard for dealing with decentralized financial rules and protocols.



#### SRP(Social Rule Protocol) 

It is a standard of rules and agreements for dealing with social relationships and social activities.



ORP is the cornerstone of all other RPs.

# ORP

Orginazation Rule Protocol.

Based on the definition of RP, it is to solve the collaborative relationship between members within an organization.

ORP defines the **three-way circular** relationship of governance, business, and economy.

Under the three-way cyclical relationship, the organization dynamically solves its development problems in an orderly and progressive manner.

**Governance** is the setting of rules within an organization.

**Business** is to assigne and reward to organization members through tasks.

**Economy** reflects the contribution and authority relationships among organization members.

## Governance

Governance is the brain of the **three-way circular** relationship.

Governance is an organization in which people with special authority provide rules that are beneficial to the further development of the organization through proposals and voting within the organization.



##### Governance Rights

Governance rights are obtained by those who have made outstanding contributions or have certain functions in the organization.

People with governance rights are managers who exist to solve a certain business, a certain relationship, and a certain distribution in the organization.

The governance rights of a certain category will not belong to just one person, but to multiple individuals or organizations.



##### Governance Methods

The proposal voting method is the opposite of the centralized decision-making method. It is the will of the majority that determines the development of the organization.

Within the organization, people with proposal rights can propose their own rule proposals for certain business scenarios. People with voting rights within the organization vote on the proposal. If the proposal pass rate is finally reached, the proposal rules will be executed.

##### Governance Security

In order to avoid proposers and voters jointly cheat to destroy the economic and business system within the organization. After a proposed rule is passed, it will enter the rule security queue. If it is a malicious proposed rule, then the organization in charge of the security queue can immediately veto it, and the malicious proposal will not be executed.

## Business

A business is an organization with specific business usage scenarios.

The specific form of business, usually in the form of tasks.

Members within the organization can obtain Token incentives from the organization by completing the rule tasks for the approval of proposals within the organization.

Through excellent rules, the organization attracts external members with the same consensus to join, and continues to grow the organization.

There are collaboration, dependency and other relationships between tasks.

## Economy

The contributions of members within the organization need to be quantified in a reasonable and fair manner.

In web3, giving rewards in the form of Tokens and NFTs is the best objective and transparent way.

As long as members complete specific tasks, they can receive rewards from the organization's treasury (token pool).



Token is a fungible token that can generally be used as a reward for members’ contributions.

NFT non-fungible tokens can represent the user’s functional authority within a certain organization.

# ORP operating paradigm

When the organization is created, the output strategy and reward strategy for Token and NFT will be formulated.

The contributions of members within the organization are quantified, and rewards are allocated from the treasury to members who have made corresponding contributions according to rules.

Members obtain permission NFT and can propose rules and vote within the organization.

After members obtain NFT and Token, they can circulate them through free transactions.

# ORP contract

#### Governance Contract

Two ways of governance

1. Governance Token: Only users who hold the organization’s governance tokens can propose and vote
2. Address mode: one address, one vote, no repeated voting.

#### Qualification Verification Contract

Only users who hold a certain NFT can make proposals or vote

When creating a proposal or voting, the organization's Token can also be consumed or charged as a fee.

#### Time lock contract

If a proposal is passed maliciously, it can be vetoed by the organization during the time lock queued period. reduce the risk.

#### Token Pool Contract

It is an organization's asset co-management system, used to control the organization's token output and NFT issuance.

#### Rule Contract

The token transfer of the organization is completed through the calls of rules. Users can choose the rules they need to call to transfer tokens.

Rules can be blind box, airdrop, mining, trading, synthesis, decomposition, etc.

The diversity of rules depends entirely on the consensus definition within the organization.
